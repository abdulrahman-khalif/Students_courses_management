The project, titled "K-PORTAL," aims to develop a comprehensive student course management system website. In an increasingly digital educational landscape, there's a growing need for centralized platforms to streamline course administration, communication, and resource sharing. K-PORTAL addresses this need by providing students and instructors with a user-friendly interface to manage courses, access learning materials, submit assignments, and communicate effectively. By leveraging modern web technologies, K-PORTAL seeks to enhance the learning experience, promote collaboration, and facilitate efficient course management processes. With a focus on usability, scalability, and customization, K-PORTAL aims to become an indispensable tool for educational institutions and learners, empowering them to navigate the complexities of academia with ease and efficiency.
